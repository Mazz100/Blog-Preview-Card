### Continued development
- I want to keep practicing and learn more about pseudo classes like ::before,::after and understand how to use effeciently.
- Practice more with transitions and achieve more smoother transitions.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-irl.info/animating-underlines/) - This helped me with underline transition and pseudo-classes. I will definitely use it again in future projects.
